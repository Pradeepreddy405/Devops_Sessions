## 1 What is DevOps ?

 - DevOps is an engineering approach focused on delivering software faster, reliably, and at scale by combining development, operations, automation, and continuous feedback.

 - Practically, it means I design and manage systems where code moves from commit to production through automated pipelines, with infrastructure provisioned as code, continuous monitoring, and built-in resilience.

 - For example, I work on CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, containerize applications with Docker, and orchestrate them using Kubernetes.

 - Infrastructure is managed using IaC tools like Terraform, and I ensure observability using monitoring stacks like Prometheus and Grafana.
 
 - Beyond tools, DevOps is about system design decisions like implementing blue-green deployments, auto-scaling, fault tolerance, and reducing MTTR through proper alerting and logging.

## 3 Waterfall model ?
The Waterfall Model is a traditional, linear, and sequential software development methodology where projects move steadily downwards through distinct phases—requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance(Monitoring).

Phases :
 - Requirements Analysis	: Gathering all requirements upfront.
 - System Design			: Designing the software architecture.
 - Implementation			: Coding the software.
 - Testing					: Verifying the product against requirements.
 - Deployment				: Installing the product.
 - Maintenance				: Ongoing support and updates
 
- Pros: Easy to manage due to its rigidity, clear milestones, and suitable for simple, well-understood projects.
- Cons: Inflexible to changes, high risk, and unsuitable for complex or long-term projects where requirements may change.

## 4 Agile model 

The Agile model is an iterative and incremental software development approach focusing on flexibility, continuous delivery, and collaboration. It breaks projects into small, time-boxed increments called sprints (typically 1–4 weeks), allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements rapidly, improve quality, and ensure high customer satisfaction through continuous feedback.

 - What Agile improved ?
	- Faster development (2-week sprints)
	- Continuous feedback
 - What Agile didn’t solve ?
	- Deployment still manual
	- Infrastructure still messy
	- Production issues still frequent

## 5 DevOps = Agile + Automation + Operations + Ownership
DevOps is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that unites software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It removes silos, focusing on automation, collaboration, and shared responsibility to improve efficiency.

CI/CD Pipelines				: Automating code testing and deployment to production (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual configuration (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
Monitoring & Alerting		: Real-time tracking of application performance (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Microservices				: Deploying small, independent services to improve scalability.

## 6 Waterfall vs Agile vs DevOps : Waterfall → Agile → DevOps

 #### 6.1 Waterfall : Sequential execution
 - Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Release
 #### Reality in production:
 - Feedback comes too late
 - Integration happens at the end
 - Deployment is manual and risky
 #### Failure Pattern:
 - Bugs found after months
 - Releases delayed
 - High failure rate
 
 #### 6.2 Agile : Break work into small iterations (sprints)
 - Plan → Develop → Test → Repeat (every 2–3 weeks)
 - What Agile fixed:
 - Faster feedback
 - Continuous testing
 - Better alignment with business

 Agile stops at development.
 #### It does NOT solve:

 - Deployment complexity
 - Infrastructure scaling
 - Production failures

 #### 6.3 DevOps
 - Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Feedback → Improve
 - What DevOps actually solves:
 1 Continuous Integration
 - Frequent code merges
 - Early bug detection
 
 2 Continuous Delivery / Deployment
 - Automated releases
 - No “release day chaos”
 
 3 Infrastructure as Code
 - Environments are reproducible
 
 4 Monitoring & Observability
 - Detect issues in real-time
 
 5 Faster Recovery (MTTR ↓)
 - Fix production issues quickly
 
#### Key difference
